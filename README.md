"The Final Summit" is a simple, addictive, and challenging physics-based vertical platformer built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed to showcase what can be built for the web from scratch.




## ‚ñ∫ Gameplay & Controls

The goal is to guide your character to the highest possible platform. The score is based on the height you achieve.
Game should have touch and keyboard controls as described below:
* **Move Left:** `A` or `‚óÑ` (Arrow Left)
* **Move Right:** `D` or `‚ñ∫` (Arrow Right)
* **Jump:** Hold `Spacebar` to charge your jump. The longer you hold, the higher you'll leap. Release to jump!
* **Pause/Resume:** `Escape`

## ‚ú® Features

* **Pure Vanilla JS:** No frameworks or libraries needed. It runs anywhere.
* **Physics-Based Controller:** A responsive character with gravity, friction, and air control.
* **Charge-Jump Mechanic:** A risk-reward system for precise, powerful jumps.
* **Procedural Platforms:** An endless and unique climb every time.
* **Juicy Visuals:** Squash & stretch animations, particle effects, and a parallax star background.

* [ ] **Obstacles:** Simple floating enemies or a rising danger zone from the bottom.

### Quality of Life & Tech
* [ ] **Sound Effects & Music:** Add sounds for jumping, landing, and background music.
* [...**Touch Controls:** Implement on-screen controls for mobile devices.
* [ ] **Persistent High Score:** Use `localStorage` to save the player's best score.
* [ ] **Code Refactoring:** Separate the CSS and JavaScript into their own files (`style.css`, `game.js`).
