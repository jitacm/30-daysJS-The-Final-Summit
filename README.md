"The Final Summit" is a simple, addictive, and challenging physics-based vertical platformer built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed to showcase what can be built for the web from scratch.

## ► Gameplay & Controls

The goal is to guide your character to the highest possible platform. The score is based on the height you achieve.
Game should have touch and keyboard controls as described below:
* **Move Left:** `A` or `◄` (Arrow Left)
* **Move Right:** `D` or `►` (Arrow Right)
* **Jump:** Hold `Spacebar` to charge your jump. The longer you hold, the higher you'll leap. Release to jump!
* **Pause/Resume:** `Escape`

## ✨ Features

* **Pure Vanilla JS:** No frameworks or libraries needed. It runs anywhere.
* **Physics-Based Controller:** A responsive character with gravity, friction, and air control.
* **Charge-Jump Mechanic:** A risk-reward system for precise, powerful jumps.
* **Procedural Platforms:** An endless and unique climb every time.
* **Juicy Visuals:** Squash & stretch animations, particle effects, and a parallax star background.

## 💻 How to Play Locally

No build process or server required!

1.  Clone or download this repository.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Ideas for Improvement

Looking for a way to contribute? Here are some ideas to get you started!

### Gameplay Features
* [ ] **New Platform Types:** Bouncy, Icy, or Disappearing platforms.
* [ ] **Power-ups:** A jetpack for a short boost or a shield to survive one fall.
* [ ] **Obstacles:** Simple floating enemies or a rising danger zone from the bottom.

### Quality of Life & Tech
* [ ] **Sound Effects & Music:** Add sounds for jumping, landing, and background music.
* [...**Touch Controls:** Implement on-screen controls for mobile devices.
* [ ] **Persistent High Score:** Use `localStorage` to save the player's best score.
* [ ] **Code Refactoring:** Separate the CSS and JavaScript into their own files (`style.css`, `game.js`).


##  Challenge Details

### About the #30DaysDevChallenge

The #30DaysDevChallenge is an initiative by the **JIT ACM Student Chapter** to encourage students to build projects, learn new technologies, and foster a culture of development and collaboration over a period of 30 days.

### My Journey

This project was built from a single `index.html` file to demonstrate how much can be accomplished with foundational web technologies. Throughout the challenge, I focused on:
* Implementing a clean game loop with `requestAnimationFrame`.
* Creating a physics system from scratch.
* Managing game states (menu, playing, paused, game over).
* Using CSS variables and keyframe animations to create a dynamic and appealing visual experience without a graphics library.
